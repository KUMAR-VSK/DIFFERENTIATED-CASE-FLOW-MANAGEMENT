STATEMENT OF FACTS
==================

I, Sarah Johnson, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:

1. I am over the age of 18 and competent to testify to the matters set forth herein.

2. On January 15, 2026, at approximately 2:30 PM, I was walking east on Main Street near the intersection with Oak Avenue.

3. The weather was clear and sunny, with good visibility. Traffic was moderate for that time of day.

4. I observed a blue sedan vehicle traveling west on Main Street at what appeared to be excessive speed.

5. The vehicle appeared to be traveling at least 45-50 miles per hour in a 25 mph zone.

6. As I reached the crosswalk at Oak Avenue, I noticed the traffic light was red for westbound traffic on Main Street.

7. Despite the red light, the blue sedan did not slow down and proceeded through the intersection.

8. At that moment, I heard a loud impact sound coming from the intersection area.

9. I immediately turned to look and saw that the blue sedan had collided with a pedestrian who was crossing Oak Avenue in the designated crosswalk.

10. The pedestrian, later identified as Mr. Robert Davis, was thrown several feet from the impact.

11. The blue sedan continued for approximately 20-30 feet after the collision before coming to a stop.

12. I immediately called emergency services at 2:32 PM and reported the incident.

13. I remained at the scene until emergency personnel arrived and provided my contact information to the responding officer.

14. I did not witness the license plate number of the vehicle, but I can provide a detailed description of the vehicle and driver if needed.

15. I am willing to testify to these facts under oath in any legal proceeding.

AFFIDAVIT
